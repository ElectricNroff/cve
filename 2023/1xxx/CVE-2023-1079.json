A use-after-free may be triggered in asus_kbd_backlight_set when plugging/disconnecting in a malicious USB device, which advertises itself as an Asus device. Similarly to the previous known CVE-2023-25012, but in asus devices, the work_struct may be scheduled by the LED controller while the device is disconnecting, triggering a use-after-free on the struct asus_kbd_leds *led structure. A malicious USB device may exploit the issue to cause memory corruption with controlled data."
