This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Triangle MicroWorks SCADA Data Gateway. Although authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability, the existing authentication mechanism can be bypassed.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the trusted certification feature. The issue lies in the handling of the OpcUaSecurityCertificateAuthorityTrustDir variable, which allows an arbitrary file write with attacker-controlled data. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of SYSTEM. Was ZDI-CAN-20537."
