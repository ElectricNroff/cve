However, buffer overflow outcomes can vary by operating system, and outcomes such as remote code execution may be possible in some circumstances. Where they are present, operating system mitigation strategies such as address space layout randomization (ASLR) should make it difficult to leverage this vulnerability to achieve remote code execution, but we cannot rule it out as impossible. The safest course is to patch dhclient so that the buffer overflow cannot occur.",
