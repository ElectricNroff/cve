Faulty permissions on the directory \"C:\\ProgramData\\Heimdal Security\\Heimdal Agent\" allow BUILTIN\\Users to write new files to the directory. On startup, the process Heimdal.MonitorServices.exe running as SYSTEM will attempt to load version.dll from this directory. Placing a malicious version.dll in this directory will result in privilege escalation. NOTE: any affected Heimdal products are completely unrelated to the Heimdal vendor of a Kerberos 5 product on the h5l.org web site."
