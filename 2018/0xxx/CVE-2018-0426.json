The vulnerability is due to improper validation of directory traversal character sequences within the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious requests to the targeted device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain access to arbitrary files on the affected device, resulting in the disclosure of sensitive information."
