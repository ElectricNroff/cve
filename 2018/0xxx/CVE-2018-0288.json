An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to gain information to conduct additional reconnaissance attacks. The vulnerability is due to a design flaw in Cisco WRF Player. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by utilizing a maliciously crafted file that could bypass checks in the code and enable an attacker to read memory from outside the bounds of the mapped file. This vulnerability affects Cisco WebEx Business Suite meeting sites, Cisco WebEx Meetings sites, and Cisco WebEx WRF players. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvh89107, CSCvh89113, CSCvh89132, CSCvh89142."
