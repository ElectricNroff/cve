The vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protection by the web-based management interface of the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the affected interface to click a malicious link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform arbitrary actions, via the user's web browser and with the user's privileges, on an affected system. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvf71929."
