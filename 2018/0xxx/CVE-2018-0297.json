The vulnerability is due to the incorrect handling of TCP SSL packets received out of order. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted SSL connection through the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass a configured SSL AC policy to block SSL traffic. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvg09316."
