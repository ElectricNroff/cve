The vulnerability is due to the affected software improperly verifying digital signatures for software images and files that are uploaded to a device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by uploading a malicious software image or file to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass digital signature verification checks for software images and files and install a malicious software image or file on the affected device."
