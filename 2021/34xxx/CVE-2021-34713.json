This vulnerability is due to incorrect handling of specific Ethernet frames that cause a spin loop that can make the network processors unresponsive. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending specific types of Ethernet frames on the segment where the affected line cards are attached. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected line card to reboot."
