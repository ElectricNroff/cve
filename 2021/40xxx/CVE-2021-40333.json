Such practices include that network management systems and XMC20 networks are typically physically protected from direct access by unauthorized personnel and have no direct connections to the Internet, as well as are separated from other networks by means of a firewall system that has a minimal number of ports exposed (e.g., traffic to TCP port 26 should be blocked/dropped), and others that have to be evaluated case by case. Portable computers and removable storage media should be carefully scanned for viruses before they are connected to a control system."
