The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of values in Webex recording files that are stored in Webex Recording Format (WRF). An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious WRF file to a user as a link or email attachment and then persuading the user to open the file with the affected software on the local system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to crash the affected software and view memory state information."
