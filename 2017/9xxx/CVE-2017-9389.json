As a part of the functionality the device allows a user to install applications written in the Lua programming language. Also the interface allows any user to write his/her application in the Lua language. However, this functionality is not protected by authentication and this allows an attacker to run arbitrary Lua code on the device. The POST request is forwarded to LuaUPNP daemon on the device. This binary handles the received Lua code in the function \"LU::JobHandler_LuaUPnP::RunLua(LU::JobHandler_LuaUPnP *__hidden this, LU::UPnPActionWrapper *)\". The value in the \"code\" parameter is then passed to the function \"LU::LuaInterface::RunCode(char const*)\" which actually loads the Lua engine and runs the code."
