Remote attackers are able to bypass the basic editor validation to trigger cross site scripting. The XSS is persistent and the request method to inject via editor is GET. To save the editor context, the followup POST method request must be processed to perform the attack via the application side. The basic validation of the editor does not allow injecting script codes and blocks the context. Attackers can inject the code by using an editor tag that is not recognized by the basic validation. Thus allows a restricted user account to inject malicious script code to perform a persistent attack against higher privilege web-application user accounts."
