The vulnerability is due to incorrect permissions that are given to a set of users. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by logging in to the shell of an affected device and elevating their privileges by modifying environment variables. An exploit could allow the attacker to gain admin-level privileges and take control of the affected device. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvd47741. Known Affected Releases: 21.0.v0.65839."
