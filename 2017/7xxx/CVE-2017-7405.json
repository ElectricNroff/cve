By spoofing the IP address belonging to the victim's host, an attacker might be able to take over the administrative session without being prompted for authentication credentials. An attacker can get the victim's and router's IP addresses by simply sniffing the network traffic. Moreover, if the victim has web access enabled on his router and is accessing the web interface from a different network that is behind the NAT/Proxy, an attacker can sniff the network traffic to know the public IP address of the victim's router and take over his session as he won't be prompted for credentials."
