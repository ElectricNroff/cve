The file types affected are zipped or archived file types. The vulnerability is due to incorrect and different file hash values when AMP scans the file. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted email file attachment through the targeted device. An exploit could allow the attacker to bypass a configured AMP file filter.
