An attacker with a privileged network position, either a man-in-the-middle or by intercepting wireless network traffic, could exploit this vulnerability to manipulate header values sent by a client to the affected application. The attacker could cause the application to use input from the header to redirect a user from the Cisco Webex Meetings Online site to an arbitrary site of the attacker's choosing."
