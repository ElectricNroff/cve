This vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input delivered to the chat feed as part of an HTTP request. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to follow a link to attacker-controlled content. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information."
