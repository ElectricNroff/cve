The vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code if the attacker tricks a legitimate user to open a manipulated project. In order to exploit the vulnerability, a valid user must open a manipulated project file. No further privileges are required on the target system. The vulnerability could compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the engineering station. At the time of advisory publication no public exploitation of this security vulnerability was known."
