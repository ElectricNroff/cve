This memory leak could prevent traffic from being processed through the device, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to improper error handling when specific failures occur during IP fragment reassembly. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted, fragmented IP traffic to a targeted device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to continuously consume memory on the affected device and eventually impact traffic, resulting in a DoS condition. The device could require a manual reboot to recover from the DoS condition. Note: This vulnerability applies to both IP Version 4 (IPv4) and IP Version 6 (IPv6) traffic."
