It is possible to upload a file into any directory of the server. One can insert a JSP shell into the web server's directory and execute it. This leads to full system access as the configured user (e.g., Administrator) when starting from any authenticated session (e.g., a trial account). This is fixed in the 83/830122/cbs-*-hotfix-task26000 builds."
