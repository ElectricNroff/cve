This is potentially relevant when the /etc/postfix/sender_login feature is used, because a spoofed outbound message that uses a configured sender address is blocked with a \"Sender address rejected: not logged in\" error message, but a spoofed outbound message that uses a homoglyph of a configured sender address is not blocked. NOTE: some third parties argue that any missed blocking of spoofed outbound messages - except for exact matches to a sender address in the /etc/postfix/sender_login file - is outside the design goals of Postfix and thus cannot be considered a Postfix vulnerability"
