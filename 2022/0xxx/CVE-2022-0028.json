Packet-based attack protection including both (Packet Based Attack Protection > TCP Drop > TCP SYN with Data) and (Packet Based Attack Protection > TCP Drop > Strip TCP Options > TCP Fast Open);\nOR\n2. Flood protection (Flood Protection > SYN > Action > SYN Cookie) with an activation threshold of 0 connections.\n\nNOTES:\n1. It is not necessary nor advantageous to apply both the attack and flood protections. \n2. (Palo Alto Networks Aporeto software only) You should not enable either of these protections if using Aporeto software; instead, wait for and install a fixed version of PAN-OS software.\n\nPacket-Based Attack Protection Workaround (Recommended)\n\nFollow the technical documentation to configure packet-based attack protection options for all defined Security zones with URL filtering enabled in the Security profile for that zone:\nhttps://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/10-2/pan-os-admin/zone-protection-and-dos-protection/configure-zone-protection-to-increase-network-security/configure-packet-based-attack-protection\n\nThe packet-based attack protection workaround will prevent the firewall from establishing TCP sessions in impacted zones when the TCP SYN packet contains data in the three-way handshake for a TCP session. Please note that this workaround may disrupt applications that use TCP Fast Open in the zone.\n\nFlood Protection (Alternate) Workaround\n\nIf you instead decide to enable the flood protection workaround, first make sure you understand how  enabling SYN cookies will change traffic flow in the impacted zones:\nhttps://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/10-2/pan-os-admin/zone-protection-and-dos-protection/zone-defense/zone-protection-profiles/flood-protection"
