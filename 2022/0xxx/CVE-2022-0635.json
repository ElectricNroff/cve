Subsequently it was found that repeated patterns of specific queries to servers with this feature enabled could cause an INSIST failure in query.c:query_dname which causes named to terminate unexpectedly. The vulnerability affects BIND resolvers running 9.18.0 that have both dnssec-validation and synth-from-dnssec enabled. (Note that dnssec-validation auto; is the default setting unless configured otherwise in named.conf and that enabling dnssec-validation automatically enables synth-from-dnssec unless explicitly disabled) Versions affected: BIND 9.18.0",
