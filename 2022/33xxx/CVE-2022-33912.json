Packages created by the agent bakery (enterprise editions only) were not affected. Using the shipped version of the agents, the maintainer scripts located at /var/lib/dpkg/info/ will be owned by the user and the group with ID 1001. If such a user exists on the system, they can change the content of these files (which are then executed by root). This leads to a local privilege escalation on the monitored host. Version 1.6 through 1.6.9p29, version 2.0 through 2.0.0p26, version 2.1 through 2.1.0p3, and version 2.2.0i1 are affected."
